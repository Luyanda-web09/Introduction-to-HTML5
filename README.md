Accessibility: Correct syntax can enhance accessibility for users with disabilities. Semantic HTML elements convey meaning, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret the content.

The main purpose of HTML5 is to provide a standardized way to structure and present content on the web. Key objectives include:

Improved Semantics: HTML5 introduces new tags that better describe the content, making it easier for browsers and assistive technologies to understand the structure and meaning of web pages.

Multimedia Support: It natively supports audio and video elements, allowing for richer media experiences without the need for external plugins.

Device Independence: HTML5 is designed to work across various devices, ensuring consistent access to content whether on desktops, tablets, or smartphones.

Enhanced Accessibility: It aims to make web content more accessible to users with disabilities by providing better support for assistive technologies.
Overall, HTML5 enhances the way web content is created, shared, and experienced, promoting a more interactive and user-friendly web.

This course content provides an overview of HTML5, its purpose, and its evolution from earlier versions of HTML.

Understanding HTML

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which uses tags to annotate documents for web browsers.
A .html file is recognized by browsers like Chrome and Firefox, allowing them to display content correctly.
Evolution of HTML

HTML was created in 1990 to connect documents via hyperlinks, primarily for scientific use.
The introduction of graphical browsers like Mosaic in 1993 led to debates about content versus design, resulting in the "browser wars."
HTML5 and Its Guidelines

HTML5 emerged as a collaboration between W3C and other groups, focusing on standardizing features and improving accessibility.
Key guidelines include reducing reliance on external plugins, ensuring device independence, and simplifying markup to enhance usability.

The request-response cycle, explaining what occurs when a user types a URL into a browser.

Client-Server Relationship

Clients are personal devices (like laptops and phones) that request resources from servers, which store these resources.
Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN) facilitate resource sharing among multiple clients.
Understanding URLs

A URL consists of three parts: the protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), the domain (e.g., google.com), and optionally, the document.
The protocol indicates how to connect, with HTTPS being secure for sensitive transactions.
Request-Response Process

When a URL is entered, the client requests a web page, and the server responds with multiple files, not just a single web page.
If the server cannot fulfill the request, it returns an error code (e.g., 404 for "File not found").
This overview helps learners grasp the technical aspects of web interactions as they progress in HTML5.
