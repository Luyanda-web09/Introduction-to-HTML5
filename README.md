The request-response cycle, explaining what occurs when a user types a URL into a browser.

Client-Server Relationship

Clients are personal devices (like laptops and phones) that request resources from servers, which store these resources.
Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN) facilitate resource sharing among multiple clients.
Understanding URLs

A URL consists of three parts: the protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), the domain (e.g., google.com), and optionally, the document.
The protocol indicates how to connect, with HTTPS being secure for sensitive transactions.
Request-Response Process

When a URL is entered, the client requests a web page, and the server responds with multiple files, not just a single web page.
If the server cannot fulfill the request, it returns an error code (e.g., 404 for "File not found").
