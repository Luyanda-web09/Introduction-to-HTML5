Course Overview

The course starts with the basics of HTML5, focusing on syntax and semantics, which are essential for creating web pages.
It emphasizes accessibility, ensuring that web content is usable for everyone, including those with disabilities.
Course Structure

Week One: Focuses on understanding how the web works, including URL functionality and necessary tools for coding.
Week Two: Introduces the Document Object Model (DOM) and covers HTML5 elements like tags, headings, links, images, and multimedia.
Week Three: Integrates learned concepts, focusing on code validation, accessibility, domain registration, and web hosting.
Learning Objectives

Students will learn to recognize and use common HTML5 tags, understand how to use an editor, and compose HTML5 code for images and links.
The course culminates in a final project where students create a simple multipage website, emphasizing content over design.

Syntax in HTML5 is crucial for several reasons:

Structure and Clarity: Syntax defines the structure of HTML documents, ensuring that the code is organized and easy to read. Proper syntax helps both developers and browsers understand the intended layout and functionality of a webpage.

Browser Interpretation: Browsers rely on correct syntax to render web pages accurately. If the syntax is incorrect, the browser may misinterpret the code, leading to display issues or broken functionality.

Validation: Adhering to proper syntax allows for code validation, which checks for errors and ensures that the code meets web standards. Valid code is more likely to work across different browsers and devices.

Accessibility: Correct syntax can enhance accessibility for users with disabilities. Semantic HTML elements convey meaning, making it easier for assistive technologies to interpret the content.
